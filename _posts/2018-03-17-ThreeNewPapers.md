The papers entitled "<i>Exact analytical solution of irreversible binary dynamics on network</i>", "<i>Geometric evolution of complex networks</i>", and "<i>Phase transition of the susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on time-varying configuration model networks</i>" have been accepted and published in Phys. Rev. E. 


The latter is a game-changer paper that describes transitions of the SIS dynamics on time-varying networks. Instead of having a single global critical exponent, we developed a framework to obtain critical exponents as a function of the degree of nodes. It leads to the new interpretation and understanding of hub and collective activations.

The paper <i>Geometric evolution of complex networks</i> introduces a new geometric model of complex networks. In doing so, we interpolate and quantify the phase transition of the network structure between the random and geometric phases; where the clustering coefficient goes from zero to a constant.
