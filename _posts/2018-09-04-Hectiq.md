I’m glad to announce that I’m joining the team at <a href="https://www.hectiq.ai">Hectiq.ai</a>, led by Martin Laprise. Hectiq.ai is a data analysis company specialized in artificial intelligence. Depending on the problem, we, however, explore different approaches, such as Bayesian inference, graph theory, deep learning, just to name a few. For now, I’ll be working part-time until the completion of my PhD program.
