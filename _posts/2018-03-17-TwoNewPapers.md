The papers entitled "<i>Exact analytical solution of irreversible binary dynamics on network</i>" and "<i>Geometric evolution of complex networks</i>" have been accepted and published in Phys. Rev. E. The latter introduces a new geometric model of complex networks. In doing so, we interpolate and quantify the phase transition of the network structure between the random and geometric phases; where the clustering coefficient goes from zero to a fixed constant.
