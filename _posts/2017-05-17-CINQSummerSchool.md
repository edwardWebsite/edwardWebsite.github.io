On May 15 and 16, I was assisting a <a href="http://www.cinq.ulaval.ca/connectivite2017">summer school</a> on the connectivity of the brain. The <a href="http://www.capitale.gouv.qc.ca/parcs-et-places-publiques/parcs/domaine-cataraqui">Domain Cataraqui</a> has been well chosen to host the school and provided a quiet environment.
