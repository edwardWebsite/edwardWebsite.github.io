How can we detect an attack on a complex system by measuring the activity of its components? That is the question, but not exclusively, we have tried to answer at the Dynamica Workshop in Charlevoix. The activity consists in renting a nice remote workspace and intensively work for a week on a research project. The endeavor has been an indubitable success as we achieved to develop quite accurate methods to leverage structured data to pinpoint the disrupted component of the graph structure. It will surely lead to a refreshing publication in 2019!
