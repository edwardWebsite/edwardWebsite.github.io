In September, I will attend a (late)  <a href="http://mediterraneanschoolcomplex.net">summer school</a> in Sicily, Italy. The four major themes of the school are closely related to my research interests: complex networks, nonlinear dynamics, synchronization and biological systems. Among the invited experts are Alex Arenas, Tiago Peixoto and Vito Latora.
