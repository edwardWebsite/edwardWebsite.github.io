Our new paper proposes a formalism to reduce large systems of differential equations coupled by a certain graph structure. We exposed how the spectral properties of the graph can be leveraged to obtain a valid effective low-dimensional representation. Our work leads to a highly interpretable analysis of resilience of complex systems. PRX is an open-source journal from the APS society.
