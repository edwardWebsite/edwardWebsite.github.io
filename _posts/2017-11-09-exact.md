I'm proud to release a paper called *Exact analytical solution of irreversible binary dynamics on networks*. Our contribution is analytic and numerical in nature. We obtain an analytical solution to cascade dynamics and propose an algorithm to solve the equations as efficiently as possible. We made available the <a href="https://github.com/laurencee9/exact_binary_dynamics">code</a> solving the equations.
