On the same day of my doctorate exam, I was awarded a scholarship by <a href="http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/accueil">Fonds de recherche du Québec - Nature et technologies</a> to pursue my PhD. This scholarship is <a href="http://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/index.php?id=news&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=96&cHash=16d5a2564abc2b50bdf715457539ba35">awarded based</a> on the research track record of the candidates, as well as the quality and originality of their proposed work.
