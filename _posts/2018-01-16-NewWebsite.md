My personal website has been updated with a new architecture and design. The website is in jekyll and the theme is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium">centrarium</a>. I've erased the posts before March 2017.

In the <i>news</i> page, I've placed an animation (made with <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> and may not work on all devices) to catch the eyes. The animation is different each time the page is reloaded. Compared to the old website, a <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> tabs has been added. Take a look!
